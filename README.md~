java exercises of a newbie

My coding style (in codes written in later than 13 March 2019) :
1. No {} is in the line with anything else
2. Spaces are beatiful. Therefore spaces for everyone
`
if ( number % 2 == 0 )
{
    System.out.print( "Given number is even" + "\n" );
}
else
{
    System.out.print( "Given number is odd" + "\n" );
}
`

Warning!
Codes in this repository (definitely) maybe (absolutely) painfully dirty.
I am open to advices on how to write cleaner code.

Goals of this repository:
* Keep myself motivated to practice Java regularly
* Get familiar with Git and CLI to be better prepared for work environment

Helpful resources:
* [Git](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html)
* [Java](https://stepik.org/course/6858/syllabus)
* [README.md](http://lmgtfy.com/?s=d&q=how+to+markup+.md+file)

Mind your eyes for typos (especially in commit messages)
